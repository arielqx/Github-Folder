Hi I am **Ariel**. 

I am a Year 2 student studying _Communications and New Media_. I like reading both English and Chinese literature and spend my free time watching movies, and reading books. I also play the piano and volunteer in my free time.

I am excited to learn coding because I believe it will be a fun and interesting skill to have. Although I am not, and have not been, very good with numbers, I have heard from the lectures that coding is more of a language. So I hope to approach this module with an open mind and learn as much as I can!

Here's a picture of me that I took for my volunteering back in 2020! 


```{r, out.height= "280px",out.width= "280px",echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,fig.cap="$A picture of me$"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Ariel/Downloads/nus/y2s1/nm2207/Week-1/BLYN-profile-photo.jpg")
```

Fun fact! 

I volunteered with the President's Challenge last year and got to meet Mdm President! 

Here's a picture from that exciting experience!

```{r, out.height= "280px",out.width= "280px",echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,fig.cap="$storytelling$"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Ariel/Downloads/nus/y2s1/nm2207/Week-1/President's Challenge.jpg")
```


Here's a screenshot of the R studio! 
```{r, out.height= "280px",out.width= "280px",echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,fig.cap="$R studio$"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/Ariel/Downloads/nus/y2s1/nm2207/Week-1/RStudio.png")

_Thanks for reading!_ 
*See you next week*
