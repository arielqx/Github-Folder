## Diary Entry #4 

After starting on the data analysis and visualization, some challenges encountered involved the scope and perimeters I had set for the project at the start:

**Instead of doing data analysis for all 20 teams in the EPL, I narrowed it down to 6**

-   This is because the previous scope for analysis was too broad and the data could not be represented well visually

-   With just 6 teams instead, the data can be represented more evenly and better.

-   Using the 6 teams as a sample is also viable considering the history of their performance in the EPL.

-   This would be better than relying on the big 4, as it gives more teams' data to look at.

\- end -
